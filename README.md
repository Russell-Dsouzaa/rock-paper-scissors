### Took me 1.5 hours to write the javaScript program and an hour to rectify bugs and logical errors

Also, the very first time that we load the live server, the console.log(); outputs arn't shown even if we open the browser console. 
The brower console updates all of the console.log(); outputs all at once, once we exit the program.

From second time onwards, the browser console updates as expected.
`( Honestly, I don't understand why or how this console BS behaves the way it does, but it is what is it ig )`

## How to Play : 
    For those of y'all who live under a rock, and somehow don't yet know how rock-paper-scissors is played, Let me enlighten y'all.
        - Rock beats Scissors
        - Paper beats Rock
        - Scissors beats Paper
    
    As soon as you load the webpage onto the Web browser, make sure to open the browser console. (ctrl + shift + I) on windows, or (cmd + opt + I) on mac.
    Alternatively, you can use the browser's settings to navigate to the browser console
        3 dots > more tools > developer tools > console (make sure you're in console pane, by default it opens up the elements pane)

## Rules :
    1. Each match consists of 5 rounds.
    2. Every round prompts the user to enter an input(rock,paper,scissors).
        `Note: If the user inputs anything else apart from rock, paper or scissors(case insensitive), the browser keeps on prompting the user over and over again until they enter one of the valid inputs.`
    3. After the match ends, the user is prompted to exit or to play again(Y/N)
        `Note: If the user inputs anything else apart from y or n(case insensitive), the browser keeps on prompting the user over and over again until they comply.`
