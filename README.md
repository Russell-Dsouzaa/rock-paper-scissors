### Took me 1.5 hours to write the javaScript program and an hour to rectify bugs and logical errors

Also, the very first time that we load the live server, the console.log(); outputs arn't shown even if we open the browser console. 
The brower console updates all of the console.log(); outputs all at once, once we exit the program.

From second time onwards, the browser console updates as expected.
( Honestly, I don't understand why or how this console BS behaves the way it does, but it is what is it ig )
