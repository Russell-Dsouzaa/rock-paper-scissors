## Took me roughly 2 hours to refactor the existing program. This includes, adding the buttons, styling them and adding some additional functionalities

Also, the very first time we load the server, the icons within the buttons might not load at all. In such cases, reload the webpage.

## How to Play : 
    For those of y'all who live under a rock, and somehow don't yet know how rock-paper-scissors is played, Let me enlighten y'all.
        - Rock beats Scissors
        - Paper beats Rock
        - Scissors beats Paper
        - First to score 3 points wins

## Rules:
    Click on the buttons to submit your choice. 
    As soon as you do it, a text appears below the buttons displaying your selection, the computer's selection and the current score
    First to reach 3 points wins, which means if the score hits +3, you win, if it hits -3, you lose.
    To reset the score, click on the "Reset Score" button on the bottom left corner of the screen.

`Please, for the love of God, do not load the webpage on mobile devices. I've haven't made them responsive to mobile screens yet. So, do me a favor and stick to laptops and desktops. :)`

Additional Features: 
    - The game will keep track of the score and display it below the buttons
    - Hovering over the buttons displays a box-shadow
    - Clicking and holding down on the buttons makes the icons larger and the text to scale down until it disappears
    - Added a "Reset Score" button which resets the score back to 0

It's currently 2:23 a.m. and I feel tired. I'm gonna go to bed now. I'll push it to GitHub tomorrow ig.
